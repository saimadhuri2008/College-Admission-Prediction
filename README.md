# College-Admission-Prediction
#Objective
To develop a predictive model using linear regression to estimate a student's likelihood of college admission based on academic and profile attributes.

#Overview:
This project utilizes a dataset containing student records with features such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, GPA, university ranking, and research experience. Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis were conducted to understand key admission factors. A linear regression model was trained to predict the probability of admission, providing insights to help students assess their chances and make informed application decisions.
